0:00:15.330 --> 0:00:15.330
Look at Sword Point.
0:00:15.870 --> 0:00:15.870
In a hurry
0:00:16.950 --> 0:00:16.950
My moves are free like wind.
0:00:19.620 --> 0:00:19.620
I'm traveling.
0:00:20.370 --> 0:00:20.370
Energy.
0:00:21.450 --> 0:00:21.450
to awaken the sword spirit.
0:00:24.290 --> 0:00:24.290
In this world,
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:25.000
restless and restless
0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:26.000
Who is the provocator?
0:00:28.870 --> 0:00:28.870
Some dreams
0:00:29.500 --> 0:00:29.500
are destined to burn
0:00:30.700 --> 0:00:30.700
A fire that won't extinguish
0:00:33.290 --> 0:00:33.290
The sky is high as me
0:00:35.580 --> 0:00:35.580
How dare you fight with stars?
0:00:37.620 --> 0:00:37.620
Daoyao.
0:00:38.620 --> 0:00:38.620
All the way to Zhenzhou
0:00:40.200 --> 0:00:40.200
Put the future together
0:00:42.500 --> 0:00:42.500
A wave of success and failure
0:00:44.700 --> 0:00:44.700
Laughing and romance
0:00:47.040 --> 0:00:47.040
Fight the Empyrean Heaven
0:00:47.830 --> 0:00:47.830
I'm willing to fight to the death
0:00:49.250 --> 0:00:49.250
to protect you.
0:01:14.580 --> 0:01:14.580
This...
0:01:18.789 --> 0:01:18.789
This...
0:01:20.120 --> 0:01:20.120
In such a short time,
0:01:21.539 --> 0:01:21.539
I didn't expect him to become stronger again.
0:01:23.750 --> 0:01:23.750
He managed to master
0:01:25.500 --> 0:01:25.500
to a perfect level.
0:01:27.870 --> 0:01:27.870
Even if he has been enlightened since birth,
0:01:30.450 --> 0:01:30.450
it's impossible for him to master this swordsmanship.
0:01:32.750 --> 0:01:32.750
can prove his extraordinary talent.
0:01:44.250 --> 0:01:44.250
No.
0:01:45.250 --> 0:01:45.250
Impossible.
0:01:56.250 --> 0:01:56.250
Lin Beichen, what are you doing?
0:01:57.330 --> 0:01:57.330
Are you trying to take advantage of me?
0:01:58.330 --> 0:01:58.330
Lin Beichen, what do you want?
0:02:01.540 --> 0:02:01.540
You are not convinced?
0:02:02.700 --> 0:02:02.700
Why don't you come up and fight me?
0:02:04.790 --> 0:02:04.790
I...
0:02:06.410 --> 0:02:06.410
Lin Beichen.
0:02:07.830 --> 0:02:07.830
Win!
0:02:11.200 --> 0:02:11.200
He is Lin Beichen.
0:02:13.160 --> 0:02:13.160
So he is the general who is the descendant of Lin Beichen.
0:02:14.910 --> 0:02:14.910
I like it. So handsome.
0:02:15.910 --> 0:02:15.910
Amazing!
0:02:17.200 --> 0:02:17.200
Amazing!
0:02:20.950 --> 0:02:20.950
Qingxuan.
0:02:22.079 --> 0:02:22.079
What do you think about
0:02:24.160 --> 0:02:24.160
What do you think?
0:02:25.540 --> 0:02:25.540
Not bad.
0:02:27.329 --> 0:02:27.329
Is it okay?
0:02:28.910 --> 0:02:28.910
The opponent is too weak.
0:02:30.750 --> 0:02:30.750
We can't conclude it for now.
0:02:33.910 --> 0:02:33.910
Brother Qingxuan is right.
0:02:36.620 --> 0:02:36.620
I was right.
0:02:38.450 --> 0:02:38.450
Even Li Qingxuan can't deny
0:02:40.450 --> 0:02:40.450
Lin Beichen's strength.
0:02:42.079 --> 0:02:42.079
Lin Beichen is our
0:02:43.410 --> 0:02:43.410
our biggest hope this year.
0:02:45.579 --> 0:02:45.579
Third College.
0:02:46.450 --> 0:02:46.450
This year, I'm finally going to be proud.
0:02:49.700 --> 0:02:49.700
The 50 winners
0:02:51.829 --> 0:02:51.829
draw lots again to pick your opponent.
0:02:55.040 --> 0:02:55.040
It's fate to meet Seven.
0:02:58.000 --> 0:02:58.000
Coming. He looks so handsome.
0:02:58.910 --> 0:02:58.910
He's looking at me. It's Lin Beichen.
0:03:00.580 --> 0:03:00.580
He was so cool when he killed Leng Ye.
0:03:03.120 --> 0:03:03.120
I told you
0:03:04.160 --> 0:03:04.160
He's handsome when he doesn't get sick.
0:03:06.700 --> 0:03:06.700
They finally
0:03:07.500 --> 0:03:07.500
the essence of a handsome man.
0:03:09.080 --> 0:03:09.080
You're so ignorant.
0:03:11.370 --> 0:03:11.370
Isn't this Xue Yue from Class 9?
0:03:13.200 --> 0:03:13.200
Help!
0:03:14.620 --> 0:03:14.620
Xue Yue.
0:03:15.450 --> 0:03:15.450
Hurry.
0:03:17.579 --> 0:03:17.579
Wu Xiaofang.
0:03:18.579 --> 0:03:18.579
You've gone too far.
0:03:19.329 --> 0:03:19.329
I know.
0:03:21.500 --> 0:03:21.500
Really?
0:03:22.620 --> 0:03:22.620
I didn't foul.
0:03:23.750 --> 0:03:23.750
He's not as good as others.
0:03:25.750 --> 0:03:25.750
I told you.
0:03:26.790 --> 0:03:26.790
I'll beat everyone
0:03:27.700 --> 0:03:27.700
I'll beat them up.
0:03:29.120 --> 0:03:29.120
If you have to blame someone,
0:03:30.450 --> 0:03:30.450
it's your fault
0:03:31.579 --> 0:03:31.579
Lin Beichen.
0:03:33.910 --> 0:03:33.910
You...
0:03:42.950 --> 0:03:42.950
Hey.
0:03:43.829 --> 0:03:43.829
You look familiar.
0:03:47.250 --> 0:03:47.250
Lin Beichen.
0:03:48.329 --> 0:03:48.329
Don't go too far.
0:03:50.329 --> 0:03:50.329
I remember you're in Class 1 too.
0:03:52.950 --> 0:03:52.950
That's right.
0:03:53.829 --> 0:03:53.829
My best friend
0:03:54.750 --> 0:03:54.750
is Wu Xiao Fang.
0:04:12.910 --> 0:04:12.910
Stop fighting. So handsome.
0:04:13.910 --> 0:04:13.910
I give up.
0:04:14.700 --> 0:04:14.700
I give up! Lin Beichen wins!
0:04:16.500 --> 0:04:16.500
He beat the opponent to tears.
0:04:18.410 --> 0:04:18.410
He's amazing.
0:04:21.040 --> 0:04:21.040
Mu Xin Yue.
0:04:22.450 --> 0:04:22.450
Goddess.
0:04:26.080 --> 0:04:26.080
Mu Xin Yue.
0:04:28.120 --> 0:04:28.120
Goddess.
0:04:29.750 --> 0:04:29.750
Look here.
0:04:36.620 --> 0:04:36.620
Senior Mu.
0:04:37.659 --> 0:04:37.659
I specially made this sword.
0:04:39.370 --> 0:04:39.370
so that I can give it to you in the middle of the year.
0:04:44.830 --> 0:04:44.830
Mu Xin Yue will win!
0:04:48.200 --> 0:04:48.200
Thank you.
0:04:49.409 --> 0:04:49.409
But this is too precious.
0:04:50.620 --> 0:04:50.620
I can't accept it.
0:04:52.000 --> 0:04:52.000
I accept your kindness.
0:04:55.000 --> 0:04:55.000
I know I don't deserve Senior Mu.
0:04:56.909 --> 0:04:56.909
and I'm no match for Senior Mu.
0:04:58.830 --> 0:04:58.830
I'm already satisfied
0:05:00.660 --> 0:05:00.660
with Senior Mu.
0:05:03.120 --> 0:05:03.120
Boe.
0:05:04.040 --> 0:05:04.040
E
0:05:05.040 --> 0:05:05.040
Three.
0:05:05.370 --> 0:05:05.370

0:05:08.080 --> 0:05:08.080
Heart Moon Wins!
0:05:09.540 --> 0:05:09.540
Mu Xin, Mu Xin, Mu Xin, Mu Xin Yue.
0:05:13.290 --> 0:05:13.290
No way.
0:05:14.120 --> 0:05:14.120
Again?
0:05:18.450 --> 0:05:18.450
Yue Hong Xiang wins.
0:05:27.580 --> 0:05:27.580
Ko Min-seung.
0:05:32.000 --> 0:05:32.000
Yoon Yi-seung.
0:05:35.659 --> 0:05:35.659
Cheers Mako-chan wins!
0:05:38.080 --> 0:05:38.080
The 25 winners, please draw lots one by one.
0:05:43.159 --> 0:05:43.159
Itâ€™s really unique.
0:05:46.200 --> 0:05:46.200
There are 25 trainees in this round.
0:05:48.409 --> 0:05:48.409
The moon is in the sky.
0:05:49.870 --> 0:05:49.870
automatically advances.
0:05:52.200 --> 0:05:52.200
Not only is Senior Mu beautiful, but also strong.
0:05:54.290 --> 0:05:54.290
but also so lucky.
0:05:55.870 --> 0:05:55.870
The only wheel is drawn by the goddess.
0:05:57.790 --> 0:05:57.790
It's fate.
0:05:59.330 --> 0:05:59.330
I can't even be jealous.
0:06:04.160 --> 0:06:04.160
That works?
0:06:05.620 --> 0:06:05.620
Lin Beichen from Class 9, Grade 2.
0:06:07.700 --> 0:06:07.700
The opponent is Gao Min,
0:06:11.540 --> 0:06:11.540
Gao Min is one of the top genius in our grade.
0:06:14.370 --> 0:06:14.370
I'm afraid Lin Beichen will be back to his original form this time.
0:06:20.500 --> 0:06:20.500
Lin Beichen.
0:06:21.790 --> 0:06:21.790
I will let you know
0:06:24.410 --> 0:06:24.410
what the real grade genius is like.
0:07:14.870 --> 0:07:14.870
I give up.
0:07:17.620 --> 0:07:17.620
Lin Beichen won again.
0:07:18.660 --> 0:07:18.660
Lost? So amazing.
0:07:21.200 --> 0:07:21.200
He's so handsome.
0:07:22.290 --> 0:07:22.290
He's so handsome that he has the potential to be a sea king.
0:07:23.910 --> 0:07:23.910
You shallow makeup.
0:07:25.660 --> 0:07:25.660
Didn't you see he used another sword
0:07:26.910 --> 0:07:26.910
with another sword?
0:07:28.080 --> 0:07:28.080
This sword
0:07:28.700 --> 0:07:28.700
is really cool.
0:07:31.830 --> 0:07:31.830
You...
0:07:33.120 --> 0:07:33.120
What swordsmanship is this?
0:07:35.409 --> 0:07:35.409
Basic swordsmanship.
0:07:36.659 --> 0:07:36.659
Closer three times.
0:07:38.040 --> 0:07:38.040
That's impossible.
0:07:39.000 --> 0:07:39.000
I also practiced the three-style swordsmanship taught by Ding.
0:07:41.120 --> 0:07:41.120
It's not that powerful.
0:07:42.450 --> 0:07:42.450
Then...
0:07:43.659 --> 0:07:43.659
Maybe you're too stupid.
0:07:46.409 --> 0:07:46.409
You...
0:07:48.620 --> 0:07:48.620
I lost.
0:07:52.500 --> 0:07:52.500
Lin Beichen wins!
0:07:54.580 --> 0:07:54.580
Brother Qing Xuan.
0:07:55.659 --> 0:07:55.659
How is it this time?
0:07:57.330 --> 0:07:57.330
Lin Beichen has proved himself.
0:08:00.910 --> 0:08:00.910
He is indeed talented.
0:08:02.540 --> 0:08:02.540
But there's no rush.
0:08:04.080 --> 0:08:04.080
Let's wait and see.
0:08:05.660 --> 0:08:05.660
Okay.
0:08:08.750 --> 0:08:08.750
Could the Lin family
0:08:10.370 --> 0:08:10.370
a genius in the Lin family?
0:08:25.790 --> 0:08:25.790
Wu Xiaofang went too far.
0:08:27.370 --> 0:08:27.370
He took advantage of the privilege of winning last time
0:08:28.910 --> 0:08:28.910
to choose Yin Yi.
0:08:30.250 --> 0:08:30.250
He deliberately picked one of Yin's ears.
0:08:39.620 --> 0:08:39.620
Lin Beichen.
0:08:40.500 --> 0:08:40.500
Wait.
0:08:43.909 --> 0:08:43.909
Can you win the next round?
0:08:47.790 --> 0:08:47.790
Only you are left
0:08:49.540 --> 0:08:49.540
is you.
0:08:50.870 --> 0:08:50.870
Lin Beichen, you must win.
0:08:53.370 --> 0:08:53.370
Wu Xiaofang has gone too far!
0:08:55.040 --> 0:08:55.040
Xue and Cheng Fei,
0:08:56.040 --> 0:08:56.040
and Yin Yi
0:08:56.870 --> 0:08:56.870
were badly injured by him.
0:08:58.750 --> 0:08:58.750
If you can defeat Wu Xiaofang,
0:09:00.250 --> 0:09:00.250
and take revenge for us,
0:09:01.370 --> 0:09:01.370
I...
0:09:02.750 --> 0:09:02.750
I'm willing to apologize for
0:09:05.370 --> 0:09:05.370
for what I said to you.
0:09:06.370 --> 0:09:06.370
I'll do it too.
0:09:07.410 --> 0:09:07.410
I won't call you an idiot anymore.
0:09:08.870 --> 0:09:08.870
Yes.
0:09:09.540 --> 0:09:09.540
Wu Xiao was a real scum just now.
0:09:11.120 --> 0:09:11.120
He was just pretending.
0:09:13.160 --> 0:09:13.160
Lin Beichen.
0:09:13.870 --> 0:09:13.870
You must win.
0:09:15.790 --> 0:09:15.790
Boring.
0:09:20.790 --> 0:09:20.790
There are 13 trainees in this round.
0:09:22.870 --> 0:09:22.870
Mu Xin will automatically advance.
0:09:26.120 --> 0:09:26.120
In this round,
0:09:27.000 --> 0:09:27.000
Lin Beichen versus Wang Xin Yu.
0:09:37.870 --> 0:09:37.870
Why did he use a hidden weapon? Yeah, he went too far.
0:09:40.290 --> 0:09:40.290
Lin Beichen wins!
0:09:43.120 --> 0:09:43.120
Oh my god.
0:09:44.160 --> 0:09:44.160
So heartless.
0:09:45.000 --> 0:09:45.000
Why is there only one sword again?
0:09:46.910 --> 0:09:46.910
He's amazing!
0:09:48.620 --> 0:09:48.620
Awesome!
0:09:57.540 --> 0:09:57.540
Wu Xiao Fang wins.
0:10:07.750 --> 0:10:07.750
Yue Hongxiang wins.
0:10:09.120 --> 0:10:09.120
The moon is in the sky.
0:10:10.410 --> 0:10:10.410
automatically advances.
0:10:11.790 --> 0:10:11.790
Wu Xiao Fang wins.
0:10:13.000 --> 0:10:13.000
Yue Hongxiang wins!
0:10:14.540 --> 0:10:14.540
Lin Beichen wins!
0:10:15.870 --> 0:10:15.870
These four trainees
0:10:17.250 --> 0:10:17.250
are the top four contestants
0:10:19.370 --> 0:10:19.370
of our third College.
0:10:20.750 --> 0:10:20.750
I hope you can
0:10:22.370 --> 0:10:22.370
the best state
0:10:23.660 --> 0:10:23.660
Show your real strength.
0:10:26.040 --> 0:10:26.040
Next,
0:10:26.910 --> 0:10:26.910
four trainees,
0:10:27.660 --> 0:10:27.660
draw lots again.
0:10:28.870 --> 0:10:28.870
to decide the opponent.
0:10:30.410 --> 0:10:30.410
This is the second-year representative
0:10:31.750 --> 0:10:31.750
the second-year representative.
0:10:34.410 --> 0:10:34.410
Last year's chief, Wu Xiaofang, was gifted.
0:10:37.040 --> 0:10:37.040
and talented.
0:10:38.500 --> 0:10:38.500
But in the last few rounds,
0:10:40.540 --> 0:10:40.540
in the last few rounds.
0:10:42.790 --> 0:10:42.790
In this round,
0:10:43.910 --> 0:10:43.910
is the best time for Lin Beichen
0:10:45.750 --> 0:10:45.750
to prove his strength.
0:10:47.040 --> 0:10:47.040
I hope I was right about him.
0:10:49.000 --> 0:10:49.000
In front of observers,
0:10:50.500 --> 0:10:50.500
in front of the observers.
0:10:53.500 --> 0:10:53.500
Yue Hongxiang starts drawing lots.
0:10:56.750 --> 0:10:56.750
You made it in the semifinal.
0:10:58.870 --> 0:10:58.870
I wonder if these moves
0:10:59.750 --> 0:10:59.750
enough to beat scumbags and green tea?
0:11:04.910 --> 0:11:04.910
Come on!
0:11:05.790 --> 0:11:05.790
Come on!
0:11:07.540 --> 0:11:07.540
Come on!
0:11:09.000 --> 0:11:09.000
Wu Xiaofang.
0:11:14.500 --> 0:11:14.500
No.4 Lin Beichen.
0:11:16.000 --> 0:11:16.000
VS No.1 Wu Xiaofang.
0:11:18.370 --> 0:11:18.370
No.2 Mu Xin Yue.
0:11:19.790 --> 0:11:19.790
VS No.3 Yue Hongxiang.
0:11:22.500 --> 0:11:22.500
Come on! Come on!
0:11:25.160 --> 0:11:25.160
Wu Xiaofang, come on! Lin Beichen is so handsome!
0:11:28.000 --> 0:11:28.000
Come on!
0:11:33.950 --> 0:11:33.950
[Third College Inter High]
0:11:36.370 --> 0:11:36.370
The semifinals
0:11:37.910 --> 0:11:37.910
begins now.
0:11:39.580 --> 0:11:39.580
Lin Beichen
0:11:40.870 --> 0:11:40.870
against Wu Xiaofang.
0:11:43.250 --> 0:11:43.250
It's nice to destroy your classmates,
0:11:46.870 --> 0:11:46.870
but it's not as good as humiliating you
0:11:50.080 --> 0:11:50.080
in front of the whole school?
0:11:52.370 --> 0:11:52.370
Your face was hit once.
0:11:53.750 --> 0:11:53.750
Not enough.
0:11:57.830 --> 0:11:57.830
You're useless.
0:12:00.000 --> 0:12:00.000
Today, I will use your blood
0:12:02.700 --> 0:12:02.700
with your blood.
0:12:07.450 --> 0:12:07.450
Charge!
0:12:07.950 --> 0:12:07.950
Kill them all!
0:12:16.580 --> 0:12:16.580
I can move!
0:12:18.080 --> 0:12:18.080
What are you waiting for?
0:12:19.290 --> 0:12:19.290
Kill!
