0:00:15.330 --> 0:00:15.790
Look at Sword Point.

0:00:15.790 --> 0:00:17.000
In a hurry

0:00:17.000 --> 0:00:19.620
My moves are free like wind.

0:00:19.830 --> 0:00:20.410
I'm traveling.

0:00:20.410 --> 0:00:21.700
Energy.

0:00:21.700 --> 0:00:23.790
to awaken the sword spirit.

0:00:24.200 --> 0:00:25.040
In this world,

0:00:25.040 --> 0:00:26.160
restless and restless

0:00:26.160 --> 0:00:28.580
Who is the provocator?

0:00:28.700 --> 0:00:29.370
Some dreams

0:00:29.370 --> 0:00:30.450
are destined to burn

0:00:30.450 --> 0:00:32.950
A fire that won't extinguish

0:00:33.200 --> 0:00:35.200
The sky is high as me

0:00:35.200 --> 0:00:37.870
How dare you fight with stars?

0:00:37.910 --> 0:00:38.540
Daoyao.

0:00:38.540 --> 0:00:40.080
All the way to Zhenzhou

0:00:40.080 --> 0:00:42.450
Put the future together

0:00:42.500 --> 0:00:44.370
A wave of success and failure

0:00:44.450 --> 0:00:46.950
Laughing and romance

0:00:47.040 --> 0:00:47.660
Fight the Empyrean Heaven

0:00:47.660 --> 0:00:49.120
I'm willing to fight to the death

0:00:49.120 --> 0:00:51.330
to protect all the people.
